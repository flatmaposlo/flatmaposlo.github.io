flatMap(Oslo) - A functional programming conference, with focus on Scala and the Java Virtual Machine.
</p>

<p>
On the 13th and 14th of May 2013, a group of enthusiasts organised the second flatMap(Oslo) conference. It was 2 amazing days. 130 attendees gathered for technical talks, workshops, discussions and craft beer. Feedback was great, and in 2014 we gather again for the 3rd annual flatMap(Oslo). We will make it a little bit bigger, and aim for 200 attendess. This was always our goal, and what we believe is the perfect size for the conference. Big enough to matter, but still intimate. Also, we can't scale past the capacity of our brewery!

<p>
flatMap(Oslo) is organised by a group of developers from Arktekk â€“ a small independent consultancy company based in Oslo, Norway. Our financial goal is to break even. Every penny we make will go into making the best possible conference. Together with our awesome sponsors we work hard to give you a conference tailored for enthusiasts of Scala and functional programming on the Java Virtual Machine.
