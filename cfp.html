<p>
Have a story to tell? Come share your knowledge and experience with functional programming. flatMap(Oslo) 2014 will include 40 minute talks and 2 hour workhops. We hope you want to join us in making flatMap(Oslo) 2014 an experience out of the ordinary.
</p>
<p>
flatMap's main focus is on Scala and other functional programming languages on the Java Virtual Machine. However, this shouldn't keep you from suggesting "something different." 
</p>
<p>
We hope we get to see some suggestions for:
<ul>
  <li>experience reports</li>
  <li>introductory and advanced technical topics</li>
  <li>2 hour workshops</li>
  <li>BoF (informal discussion groups)</li>
  <li>something weird, offbeat, eccentric, fun, interesting, ...</li>
</ul>
</p>
