title: flatMap(Oslo) Call for Speakers

<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Call for Speakers <small>share your knowledge</small></h1>
</div>

<p>
Have a story to tell? We are looking for developers who would like to share their knowledge and experience with Scala and other functional programming languages. flatMap(Oslo) 2014 will include talks and workhops, ranging from 40 minutes to 2 hours. We hope you want to join us in making flatMap(Oslo) 2014 an experience out of the ordinary.
</p>
<p>
flatMap's main focus is on Scala and other functional programming languages on the Java Virtual Machine. However, this shouldn't keep you from suggesting "something different." 
</p>
<p>
We hope we get to see some suggestions for:
<ul class="large">
  <li>experience reports</li>
  <li>introductory and advanced technical topics</li>
  <li>2 hour workshops</li>
  <li>BoF (informal discussion groups)</li>
  <li>something weird, offbeat, eccentric, fun, interesting, ...</li>
</ul>
</p>
