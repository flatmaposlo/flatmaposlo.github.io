  <p>
    The DOT (Dependent Object Types) calculus attempts to ground
    Scala's type system in fewer, but powerful, constructs. In this
    talk I will describe what these constructs are, and how they
    relate to Scala's current type system. I will also show how DOT
    simplifies type inference. Finally, I will touch upon the
    challenges in the meta-theory.
