  Morten fell in love with Scala in 2012, when he used it to build a pet project and discovered just how easy and enjoyable coding can be in Scala. Since then, he's been dreading the verbose nature of Java code. In his spare time, Morten is often seen wearing a referee kit, either on the football field or at developer conferences.

<p>
Alfred and Morten will give you a short introduction to Scala, before we all start coding. They will focus on an area that is a lot of fun for new Scala developers - the collections API. Seeing how fun, easy, and powerfull collections can be, is often an eye opener for Java developers.

<p>
This workshop is intended for experienced Java developers, with little or no prior exposure to Scala. Bring a laptop or pair up with someone who did.
