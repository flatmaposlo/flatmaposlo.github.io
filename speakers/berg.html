  Øyvind Raddum Berg is a developer at Penger.no, where he has had the
  opportunity to play and work with Scala for over two years. He has a love
  for starting new, amazing projects and discarding them two days later,
  something which has brought him to a lot of interesting platforms and
  languages.

  <h1>How we ported our application from Java to Scala</h1>
</div>

<p>
In this talk I will tell the story about how we ported our main
application to Scala.
</p>
<p>
Initial focus will be on motivation for the team and for myself. Then we
have a look at how my team tested the waters first, and how that testing
developed into a multiphased porting strategy:
<ul>
  <li>refactor Java codebase to favor immutability and static functions</li>
  <li>mechanically rewrite Java code to Scala</li>
  <li>port Java collections usage to Scala collections, introducing Option when possible</li>
  <li>restore sanity by replacing Hibernate with Scalaquery/Slick</li>
  <li>rewire with cake pattern instead of Spring</li>
  <li>regain control over HTTP by replacing Spring MVC with Unfiltered</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
By sharing some experience for each of these phases, I hope this talk can
be useful for anyone considering doing the same.
