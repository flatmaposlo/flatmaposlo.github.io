  <p>
    Bodil is a compulsive conference speaker in the fields of
    functional programming and internets technologies, and is a
    co-organiser of multiple developer conferences in Scandinavia and
    the UK, mostly because sheâ€™s still learning how to stop. She is a
    prolific contributor to the Free Software community, and has
    recently taken up designing new programming languages as a hobby.
    In her spare time, she works as a developer for Future Ad Labs, a
    London based startup that wants to make advertising a productive
    member of society. Her favourite pony is Pinkie Pie.

    In this talk, we'll explore why some technologies end up
    inexplicably dominating our field while others fade away despite
    their obvious merits. What will it take for the languages we care
    about to succeed, and what are the consequences of success? Let's
    apply a broad perspective to the mess we've made of modern
    computer science, and explore our options for getting the
    situation back on track through a careful examination of history,
    science and ponies.
