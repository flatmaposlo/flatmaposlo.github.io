  Chris Ford has been fascinated by functional programming since he first stumbled across Haskell during a misguided attempt to study electrical engineering. He came to his senses, and has spent the last seven years happily coding in various countries across the world.
</p>

  Most recently, Chris is attempting to recover from the culture shock of moving to Glasgow after a year helping to start the ThoughtWorks' Uganda office in Kampala.
