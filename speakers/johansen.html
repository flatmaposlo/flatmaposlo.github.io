<p>
Christian is a passionate programmer working with Oslo-based consultancy
Kodemaker. He's a man of eclectic background, having worked with everything from
Unix systems tuning and ops to various server-side applications and JavaScript
heavy frontend development.
</p>
<p>
Christian is the author of "Test-Driven JavaScript Development", and he
maintains several open source projects, including the JavaScript test-framework
Buster.JS and the popular mocking framework Sinon.JS. Functional programming has
been a growing interest the past years, and after some time with the wonderful
world of Clojure and its immutable data types, he realized there was no going
back.</p>

Various JavaScript toolkits have been offered the past few years to enable the
use of functional patterns on the frontend. While these tools promote composable
APIs and pure functions to a certain degree, UI programming is still encumbered
with stateful MV*-like frameworks, or just plain dirty DOM manipulation.
</p><p>
Facebook's React is an interesting approach to UI programming in the browser
that does away with manual DOM manipulation all together, and more closely
resembles classic UI programming. Combine this approach with the immutable data
structures of Clojurescript, and we're really getting somewhere.
</p><p>
In this talk I will explore the path to fully functional UI programming in the
browser through React, Clojurescript, Om (React for Clojurescript) and other
tools.
