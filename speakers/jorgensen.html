  <p>
    Having started his career as a Java developer, Simen went on to become
    co-founder and CEO of Iterate. Some might say that means Simen has
    joined the dark side - but he refuses to let go of his technical
    upbringing. His mixed career means that he takes an interest in
    business issues as well as technology, learning Organizational
    Analysis one month and Data Analysis with R the next month.

You will get 99 no's before you finally get the 1 yes you need. How do
you persist?

life success stories.
