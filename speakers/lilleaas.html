  <h1>The imminent revolution of functional append-only databases <small>Session</small></h1>

<p>
Traditional databases supports operations like "update" and "delete". How did you decide that it's OK for your business to discard old data? Are you sure this data is not relevant now, or that it will never be relevant in the future?
</p>
<p>
We'll take a look at the functional databases Event Store and Datomic. We'll mostly explore interesting business cases that functional databases solve elegantly, instead of a small (and frankly useless) getting started scenario. We'll also look at the problems that arise when we attempt to solve these problems with more traditional databases.
