  <p>
Martin Odersky is professor of computer science at EPFL in Lausanne,
Switzerland, co-founder of Typesafe, and creator of the Scala
language. 
</p><p>
For most of his career Martin has worked on the fusion of
functional and object-oriented programming. He believes the two
paradigms are two sides of the same coin, to be unified as much as
possible. 
</p><p>
To support this claim, he has worked on a number of language
designs, from Pizza to GJ to Scala. He wrote javac, the compiler used
by the majority of today's Java programmers and scalac, the compiler
used by the fast-growing Scala community. He authored "Programming in
Scala", the best selling book on Scala and pioneered two massive open
online courses on functional and reactive programming. Previously, he
held positions at IBM Research, Yale University, the University of
Karlsruhe and the University of South Australia.
