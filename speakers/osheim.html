    Erik is one of the creators of Spire, a Typelevel project designed to
    support fast, generic, and precise numerical programming in Scala. He
    is a contributor to the Scala compiler and standard library, and uses
    Scala to push the limits of JVM performance and expressiveness. Erik
    works at Meetup, where he collects, processes, and analyzes data to
    learn how to more effectively create community.

If hearing 'regular expression' makes you think of Perl or that Jamie
Zawinsky quote, think again! Kleene algebras are a generalization of
regular expressions that can be used to compute transitive closure,
shortest path, solve linear equations, and more! This talk will
explore Kleene algebras, model them in Spire, and go through several
concrete examples, with particular attention to regular expressions
and languages. We'll see how algebraic properties plus laziness allow
an amazingly expressive and powerful implementation.
