Rapture JSON is comprehensive set of tools for working with JSON in Scala which combines some of the best new features of Scala 2.10 to bridge the gap between the dynamic world of JSON and statically-typed Scala, without sacrificing the expressiveness of concise and idiomatic Scala. See how you can parse, extract and pattern match immutable JSON, or use mutable JSON to get a lightweight object database. This will be a fun, entry-level talk, with lots of examples and some live coding!
