  <h1>Doing Batshit Crazy Algebra with Scala Types! <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>
<div class="clearfix">
<p>
What would it mean to "add" or "multiply" types like Boolean and List[Int]? Would you think me mad if I applied the quadratic formula to a type constructor, expanded its power series, then tried to justify using this to count binary trees? And what interpretation could I possibly give to performing differentiation on a type constructor, and what's this got to do with zippers? I'll leave my mathematical rigor behind, and go a bit wild with types and algebra. And hopefully show that doing crazy algebraic stuff with types can actually throw up some interesting, surprising and useful results!

Rapture JSON is comprehensive set of tools for working with JSON in Scala which combines some of the best new features of Scala 2.10 to bridge the gap between the dynamic world of JSON and statically-typed Scala, without sacrificing the expressiveness of concise and idiomatic Scala. See how you can parse, extract and pattern match immutable JSON, or use mutable JSON to get a lightweight object database. This will be a fun, entry-level talk, with lots of examples and some live coding!
