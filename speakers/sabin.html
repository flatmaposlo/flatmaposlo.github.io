  <p>
    Miles does stuff with Scala for Precog: currently he's working on the
    representation of the intermediate language between Quirrel (Precog's
    query language) and its various query/storage backends.
  </p>
  <p>
    When not working on Precog, he does his utmost to break Scalaâ€™s typechecker
    with his project shapeless and is a regular speaker at Scala and
    functional programming events. 
  </p>
  <p>
    He can often be found walking in the
    South Downs around his home in Brighton with a camera and an
    unfeasibly energetic English Springer Spaniel named Tigger.

  <h1>shapeless 2.0 <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>
<div class="clearfix">
<p>
An extended workshop on the concepts, techniques and new features in 
shapeless 2.0.
</p>
<p>
The workshop will start with a walkthrough of various parts of the
library, focussing particularly on its support for generic programming,
followed by dojo style challenges using, extending or borrowing ideas
from shapeless to solve problems chosen by the participants. With any
luck we might be able to generate a few useful pull requests against
the project by the end of the session.  
</p>
<p>
If you're already using shapeless and have topics you'd like to work
through then bring them with you. And if you have questions about the
new toys in shapeless 2.0, or are new to it and just want to know what
all the fuss is about, then this is the perfect event for you.
