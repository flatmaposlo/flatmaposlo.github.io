  <p>Alf Kristian has 10 years of experience programming on the JVM, primarily Java. The last 6 years he has sought better solutions and languages, since he thinks Java the language, and its numerous frameworks, simply is not good enough. He is a believer in functional programming, and hence has a deep interest in Scala and Clojure.
  </p>
  <p>
  His commitment to FP on the JVM, has lead him to give many talks, workshops, and organize several user groups meetups for FP. He is currently co-founder and organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Socially-Functional/">Oslo Socially Functional Programmers</a>, which aims to to promote the use of FP in Oslo.
  </p>
  <p>
  Alf Kristian works as a programmer and consultant for <a href="http://www.kodemaker.no/">Kodemaker</a>, and is currently very happy programming Clojure at work.
