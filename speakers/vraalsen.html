  <h1>Functional Programming in Java 8 <small>Workshop</small></h1>
</div>
<div class="clearfix">
<p>
This workshop will teach you how you can utilise the new language features in Java 8 to program in a functional style. The main focus will be anonymous functions (lambdas), in particular the new Stream API that lets us write much more declarative code when working with collections and other data sources. Let's ditch those old for-loops and if-statements! We'll also look at lazy and parallel computations and how to work with immutable data in Java and why this is important.
</p>
<p>
Participants should have an IDE with Java 8 support, e.g. IntelliJ IDEA (community edition is fine) or <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT/Eclipse_Java_8_Support_(BETA)">Eclipse with Java 8 support</a>.
