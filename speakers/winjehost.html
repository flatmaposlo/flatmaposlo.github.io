  Einar W. Høst is a sleep-deprived developer and technical architect at Computas. In his spare time, he writes an obscure technical blog, enjoys pixel art and indulges in impractical coding projects aimed at having fun with the djinns of the computer. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oslo and thinks ivory towers are beautiful.

  <h1>Optimizing Lambda Calculus <small>Session</small></h1>
</div>
<div class="clearfix">
<p>
A successor to last year's session on the purest of the pure, the Lambda Calculus, this year's session is about predecessors. Jonas and Einar return to continue their Socratic dialog as they hunt for a more performant way to handle the daunting task of calculating the predecessor of a number. The solution will exploit the fact that in Lambda Calculus, abstractions are always dissolving before our very eyes - allowing for some clever and confusing optimizations. Along the way we will encounter Peano and see that bringing him into the fold saves the day.
